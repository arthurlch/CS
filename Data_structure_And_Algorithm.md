## Singly linked list

### What is a linked list ?

A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
Linked list consists of nodes, and each nodes has value and a pointer to another node or null. 

### Comparison with Arrays

Lists

- Do not have indexes
- Connected via nodes with a next pointer
- Random access is not allowed

Arrays 

- Indexed in order
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index

### Code example

```jsx
class Node {
constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = null;
    }
}

let first = new Node('1');
first.next.next = new Node('2');

// this is the bad way to do that but it is for the sake of the example.
// no push methods to remember the index

// to solve the push issue lets create a push methods 

class SinglyLinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null;
        this.tail = null;
        this.length = 0;
    }
    // this is the push methods talked above
    push (val) {
        var newNode = new Node(val);
        if (!this.head) {
            this.head = newNode;
            this.tail = this.head;
        } else {
            this.tail.next = newNode;
            this.tail = newNode;
        }
        this.length++;
        return this;
    }
}

  

```
